## Introduction

In today's digital age, misinformation spreads rapidly. The **Fake News Detector** aims to combat this issue by providing a machine learning model that classifies news articles as real or fake. By leveraging various NLP techniques, we can analyze text data effectively.

This repository includes code, data, and resources necessary to train and evaluate the model. You can download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/bhavithrai/fake-news-detector/releases) to get started.

## Features

- **Bag-of-Words Model**: Utilizes a simple yet effective method for feature extraction.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Implements a robust algorithm for classification tasks.
- **XGBoost Classifier**: Enhances prediction accuracy with gradient boosting.
- **Visualization**: Generates insightful plots using Matplotlib.
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes techniques to improve model performance.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear instructions for installation and usage.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates various technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques for processing and analyzing text data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Recommended IDE for development.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhavithrai/fake-news-detector.git
   cd fake-news-detector
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/bhavithrai/fake-news-detector/releases) section to download the necessary files. Make sure to extract and place them in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start using the Fake News Detector. Here's how:

1. **Load the Model**:
   Load the pre-trained model using the provided scripts.
   ```python
   import joblib
   model = joblib.load('model.pkl')
   ```

2. **Preprocess the Input**:
   Prepare your text data using the preprocessing functions provided.
   ```python
   from preprocessing import preprocess_text
   text = "Your news article text here."
   processed_text = preprocess_text(text)
   ```

3. **Make Predictions**:
   Use the model to predict whether the news is real or fake.
   ```python
   prediction = model.predict([processed_text])
   print("Prediction:", prediction)
   ```

## Model Training

To train the model from scratch, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   Ensure your dataset is in the correct format. The dataset should contain two columns: one for the text and one for the label (real or fake).

2. **Run the Training Script**:
   Execute the training script to build the model.
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Save the Model**:
   After training, save the model for future use.
   ```python
   joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')
   ```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: Measure the proportion of correct predictions.
2. **Confusion Matrix**: Visualize the performance of the model.
3. **Precision and Recall**: Assess the model's ability to identify fake news.

You can find the evaluation code in the `evaluation.py` file. Run it to see the results.
